"Q1. Differentiate between Lists, Tuples, and Arrays. Give examples and use cases for each.
A1. Feature	List	Tuple	Array
Mutability	Mutable	Immutable	Mutable
Order	Ordered	Ordered	Ordered
Data Type	Can store mixed data types	Can store mixed data types	Requires homogeneous data types
Syntax	[1, 2, 3]	(1, 2, 3)	array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
Performance	Slower than arrays for numerical operations	Faster access than lists due to immutability	More memory-efficient for homogeneous data
Use Cases	Flexible data storage, dynamic size	Constant data, dictionary keys	Numerical operations, fixed-type data
Library Support	Built-in	Built-in	array module, numpy library
Memory Usage	More memory due to dynamic size	Less memory due to immutability	Efficient for large datasets
Example	fruits = ['apple', 'banana']	coordinates = (1.0, 2.0)	array.array('d', [1.0, 2.0])"
